## The Carpentries Paradigm {.smaller}

-   **Live coding**: We teach by doing, typing code in real-time.
-   **Workshops**: Intensive, hands-on learning over 16 - 24 hours.
-   **Lessons**: Focused modules, typically 2 - 14 hours.
-   **Episodes**: Bite-sized chunks, under 2 hours each.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## With a Dash Of... {.smaller}

-   **Openness**: We lean heavily on open-source tools like R and Python.
-   **A Work in Progress**: We're actively improving how we teach reproducibility and project management.
-   **Eating our own dogfood**: We use Carpentries materials to teach Carpentries skills. (and I've never used quarto slides before)

## 2019: the Beginning {.smaller}

At the start of the journey, I was:

![Groovy mistakes](images/IMG_5925.JPG){fig-align="right" width="200px"}

-   Fresh from Carpentries Instructor training
-   Zero experience with GitHub or GitHub Pages
-   Extremely rusty (\> 10 years) geostatistical R skills

**It was a steep learning curve!**


------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 2025: Where We Are Now {.smaller}

-   Running The Carpentries Workbench independently from a cloud-hosted Linux machine with RStudio.
-   Maintainer and *ad hoc* chair of a committee editing a lesson from 2019.
-   Frequently arguing with Gemini and Copilot about their... *creative*... code suggestions.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## How did we get here? {.smaller}

-   **Dedicated time and personnel:** scheduled, weekly sessions
-   **Strong local data sources:** official campus data and a recently removed golf course
-   **Nothing new:** we completely mimicked the [existing Carpentries Lesson](https://datacarpentry.github.io/r-raster-vector-geospatial/).

## Overall Strategy: Reproducible, Runnable, Open, and Local {.smaller}

Our goal is to create learning materials that are:

-   **Properly Reproducible**: Anyone can regenerate the results.
-   **Runnable**: The code works out-of-the-box, from start to finish.
-   **Open**: All materials are publicly accessible and licensed for reuse.
-   **Local**: The context and data are relevant to our community.

## Technical Implementation {.smaller}

![4 Planet Images](images/map_08.png)

-   `run_all_episodes.R`: runs the entire lesson from start to finish.
-   `run_all_maps.R`: generates all map figures.
-   **Clean Environments**: We unload libraries and clear objects between each episode to ensure there are no hidden dependencies. `rm(list=ls())`
-   **Best-Practice Project Organization**: A clear and consistent folder structure.

## The Power of "Local" {.smaller}

-   **Data Sources**: We use readily available campus and public data.
    -   UCSB Library collections
    -   Campus facilities & ArcGIS Online
    -   North Campus Open Space (NCOS)
    -   Cheadle Center for Biodiversity and Ecological Restoration (CCBER)
    -   Common US government sources (e.g., census data)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Why Local Matters {.smaller}

-   **Outreach & Awareness**: It highlights amazing local resources.
-   **Cognitive Scaffolding**: A key factor in geodata education is landscape scale. Working with a familiar landscape like our own campus makes abstract concepts much more concrete. It's easier to understand a 30m pixel NDVI when it represents a place you walk through every day.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Whatâ€™s Next? {.smaller}

-   Can two versions of a Workbench repository live side-by-side? We are currently working in multiple forks to figure this out.
-   Repeat this entire lesson in QGIS.
-   Repeat this entire lesson in ArcGIS Online.

The journey continues!
